The mobile interactive experience is part of an international project to bring awareness to the importance of water resources and their sustainable management.<br/>The app allows users to select a Standard 3D or Augmented Reality version of a globe to discover the ocean biosphere and experience how interconnected our planet is-- from the smallest bacteria to the largest blue whale. H2O: An Ocean of Science brings together research, data, and analysis from scientists, oceanographers, zoologists, climatologists, geologists, and others to understand the challenges facing various marine environments. For each entry, references are provided to encourage further exploration. The app also allows users to submit their own observations and data as part of the conversation about climate change.<br/>The app is <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SpandrelInteractive.WaterDay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">available on Google's Playstore.</a>",

    "description": "Noxia is a 2D side-scrolling horror game focused on overcoming fears, manifested in the physical form of monsters that feed off negative emotions, something that teenagers and young adults often relate to. Players live the experience by seeing the world through the perspective of a young protagonist facing these fears.<br/>With depression as an overarching theme, the game explores other themes, such as the fear of failure and facing expectations; fear of change and the passage of time while growing up; stress, deadlines, and how we take time for granted; bullying and toxicity, being scared to be yourself because of what others will think.<br/>Featuring a pixel art style, the game is currently under development and it is expected to launch on Q4 2021.",
